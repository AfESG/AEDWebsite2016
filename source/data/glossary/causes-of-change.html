  Reason for Change
</h3>
<div class="glossary-content__section__intro">
  A new system to track changes in estimates and their ostensible reasons has been devised and implemented in the AED. The system relies on linking estimates contained in the current version of the AED to the corresponding estimates contained in the version of the AED used to produce the previous report, and assigning a cause of change to each pair of estimates, as described below. Changes in estimates are then grouped by cause of change, and overall differences in the DEFINITE, PROBABLE, POSSIBLE and SPECULATIVE categories are calculated at the national, regional and continental levels.

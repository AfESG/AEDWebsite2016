  Survey Reliabilty

    The AED incorporates a system to accommodate all types of numbers by classifying them according to their type and designating them as estimates and guesses. The new ADD system uses a scale of survey reliability, ranging from A (highest) to E (lowest). Survey reliability gives an indication of the level of certainty that can be placed on a given number, as determined by the method employed and how it was carried out.

  <p>
    Tables 1 and 2 show the different types of surveys with the range of reliabilities that could be assigned to them and how each number contributes to the columns of estimates and guesses depending on its reliability and other criteria.

      <sup>*</sup> The AfESGâ€™s Data Review Working Group (DRWG) reviews all surveys to ensure that key standards have been met and parameters included in the report to allow determination of the quality of survey design and implementation. The AfESG and its DRWG make every e ort to engage with data providers to secure any essential missing information.

      <sup>*</sup> These survey types may be downgraded to lower reliabilities and thus treated as informed or other guesses. See the criteria in Table 1.

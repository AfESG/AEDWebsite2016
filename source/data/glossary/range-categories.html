    Range Categories

  <div class="glossary-content__section__intro">
    The AED classifies elephant range information into four categories of certainty, as seen below. In addition, range information in the AED is fully documented and referenced to original sources of data. This allows some evaluation of the reliability of range information, based on how and when each record was obtained.

        </h4>
        <p class="range-categories__list__item__text">
          Areas in suitable habitat which, if searched with reasonable intensity, are likely to yield signs of elephant presence. If no information is obtained confirming the presence of elephants for a 10 year period, KNOWN range is downgraded to POSSIBLE range.

          POSSIBLE
        </h4>
        <p class="range-categories__list__item__text">
          Areas within historical range and in suitable habitat where there are no negative data to rule out the presence of elephants, including former areas of KNOWN range where the source information is more than 10 years old. Areas of POSSIBLE range are considered to be a priority for studies to establish the presence or absence of elephants.

        <p class="range-categories__list__item__text">
          Areas where there are reasons to believe that elephants are no longer present, but which have not been formally surveyed. If further corroborative evidence is obtained, areas of DOUBTFUL range are reclassified as NON-RANGE. As with POSSIBLE range, areas of DOUBTFUL range are a priority for absence/ presence studies.

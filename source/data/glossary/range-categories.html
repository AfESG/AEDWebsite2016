    Range Categories
  </h3>
  <div class="glossary-content__section__intro">
    The AED classifies elephant range information into four categories of certainty, as seen below. In addition, range information in the AED is fully documented and referenced to original sources of data. This allows some evaluation of the reliability of range information, based on how and when each record was obtained.

          Areas in suitable habitat, which, if searched with reasonable intensity, are likely to yield signs of elephant presence. If no information is obtained confirming presence of elephants for a 10-year period, known range is downgraded to possible range (below).

          POSSIBLE
        </h4>
        <p class="range-categories__list__item__text">
          Areas within previous elephant range, including former areas of known range where the source information is more than 10 years old where there is no confirmation that elephants still occur, but no evidence that they have been lost. Areas of possible range are considered to be a priority for studies to establish the presence or absence of elephants.

          DOUBTFUL
        </h4>
        <p class="range-categories__list__item__text">
          Areas where there are reasons to believe that elephants are no longer present, but for which there is no recent positive or negative information. Areas of DOUBTFUL range are also a priority for presence/absence studies.

          NON-RANGE
        </h4>
        <p class="range-categories__list__item__text">
          Areas that are believed to hold no elephants. A change to non-range ideally requires a clear statement from a knowledgeable person who has actually visited the area, though sometimes range is classified this way as a result of known habitat transformation or high human population densities.

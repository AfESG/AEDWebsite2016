  <h2>Background &amp; History</h2>
  <p>
    The African Elephant Database (AED) originated from the African Elephant Survey carried out by Iain Douglas-Hamilton in the late 1970s, which led to the first continental estimate for elephant numbers, produced in 1979 (Douglas-Hamilton, 1979). In 1986, Douglas-Hamilton and colleagues started to compile this information into a geographical information system. Using data accumulated from questionnaire replies, surveys and interviews, a database of elephant population estimates and distribution was assembled (Burrill &amp; Douglas-Hamilton, 1987). An updated version was produced in 1992 (Douglas-Hamilton et al., 1992), which included the use of spatial models to estimate populations for the central African forests, as only a very small proportion of this area had been surveyed at that time.

    In 1992, the AED became the direct responsibility of the IUCN Species Survival Commissionâ€™s African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG). Since that time, the structure and management of the AED has been overseen by a group of technical experts from within the AfESG known as the Data Review Working Group (DRWG), and chaired since mid-2014 by Dr. Chris Thouless. The DRWG oversees the selection and categorisation of data to be included in the AED; agrees on new features, tools and analyses; and reviews the content of the AESR. Decisions made by the DRWG and additional reviewers are coordinated and implemented by AfESG Secretariat staff and contracted consultants. Initially housed at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, the AED was until April 1998 a collaborative effort of the Global Environment Monitoring System (GEMS), the Global Resource Information Database (GRID) of UNEP and the IUCN/SSC AfESG. In April 1998 the AED was moved from UNEP to its present location in the AfESG offices in Nairobi. Although the AED was transitioned to a web-based platform in 2012 it continues to be managed by the AfESG Secretariat from Nairobi through this site.Today the AED is the most comprehensive database on the status of any single species of mammal in the wild.

    With the transition to an online platform (www.AfricanElephantDatabase.org), the AED has undergone its most significant change in over 20 years. This has been both challenging and rewarding, with many lessons we have learned now being used by other groups working on species databases. We hope this site contributes to a wider discussion about the value of monitoring to conservation, ensuring that policy decisions and the assessment of conservation activities are evidence-based whenever possible and that new initiatives plan and budget for support to databases to better enable the monitoring of progress and evaluation of performance.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
  	This is an update on the status of the African elephant produced under the aegis of the <a href="http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/who_we_are/ssc_specialist_groups_and_red_list_authorities_directory/mammals/african_elephant/" target="_blank">African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG)</a> of the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC). It is based on data from the African Elephant Database (AED), the official database on the conservation status of the African elephant. Since 2009, the AfESG has been working on a major shift in the infrastructure of the AED. The AED is now housed in a ‘global’ elephant database, the African and Asian Elephant Database (AAED), available through a <a href="http://www.elephantdatabase.org/" target="_blank">web interface</a>. At present, <a href="http://www.elephantdatabase.org/maps/asian_range" target="_blank">Asian elephant range</a> is available, and the <a href="http://www.asesg.org/" target="_blank">IUCN/SSC Asian Elephant Specialist Group</a> is working to integrate population data. This is an open source project and the code is available for use and modification by other Specialist Groups or the general public. The new system provides a number of advantages, not least of which is the near immediate publication of survey results as we receive them, rather than waiting for the publication of an updated set of pooled estimates.

  	There has been no change in the system for categorization of different data types. As such the elaboration on <a href="http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/who_we_are/ssc_specialist_groups_and_red_list_authorities_directory/mammals/african_elephant/data/reports/?uPubsID=3407" target="_blank">pages 6-19 of the AESR 2007</a> is a useful resource in interpreting the current update. The only change is a slight change in coding for Informed and Other Guesses. Informed guesses are noted as O (data reliability D) and other guesses are noted as O (data reliability E).

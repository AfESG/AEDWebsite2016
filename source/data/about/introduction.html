    Welcome to the African Elephant Database (AED), the most comprehensive database on the status of any species of mammal in the wild. The database is maintained by the African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG), and holds data on elephant numbers and distribution across the 37 countries where African elephants occur. It provides information on changes in elephant numbers and shows where these changes have taken place. The database has been developed over the past 25 years and went online in 2012.

    Conservation and management of elephant populations and their habitats is critical and a goal towards which many individuals, organizations and countries are working. Even if opinions differ as to how best this can be achieved, it is widely agreed that decisions should be informed by the most up-to-date and reliable information available on the status of Africa’s elephants. The AfESG maintains the AED to meet this need and provides comprehensive information for individual countries, regions, and for Africa as a whole. The AED relies on the contributions of countless survey biologists, experts and observers across the continent.

    This website contains data from surveys that were conducted on or before December 31, 2015, as well as expert opinion for that time. In the interest of making this data available sooner rather than later, the Data Review Working Group of the African Elephant Specialist Group is continuing to conduct a detailed review of these webpages. Though there may be some minor errors and discrepancies, and corrections are listed here, the Data Review Working Group believes the overall continental, sub-regional, and national summaries are reflective of the submitted data.

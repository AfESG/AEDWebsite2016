## AED Tables and Data Dictionary

### Summary Totals

These tables (see Table 5) present numbers at the national, regional and continental levels, separated into estimates and guesses. These tables depict the contribution of each survey type to the total area (in km²) for which estimates and guesses are available. In addition, areas of unassessed known and possible range are also shown.

Total numbers from the previous AESR 2007 report are also displayed in the table; the AESR 2007 data was converted into the AED’s new data display format for direct comparability, after first correcting AESR 2007 errata.

### The Interpretation of Changes in Elephant Estimates from the Previous Report

These tables show the breakdown and net changes in the estimates and guesses, grouped by the categorised reason for change.

### Elephant Estimates

These tables display the detailed inputs for each country that contribute to the summary totals and interpretation of changes tables. At the national level the table shows results for individual input zones. The centroid of each input zone is provided in decimal geographic coordinates to assist the reader in locating the areas on the accompanying maps. In addition, these input zone tables within each country present details on estimates, their reliability and other metadata, as described in Table 6. Input zones are, as a general rule, listed alphabetically. Where there are many input zones distributed across many parts of a country, sets of geographically adjoining input zones that indicate contiguous elephant populations or other geographically defined subsets are grouped into populations for ease of review and interpretation.

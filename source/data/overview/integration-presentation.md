## Integration and Presentation of Data

### Derivation of National, Regional, and Continental Totals

The categorisation system of data is implemented in the AED through a series of algorithms applied to input zones, or each area for which an individual number is listed in the country tables displaying Elephant Estimates. When executed, these algorithms categorise each input zone in terms of survey type and reliability. The categorised records are then used to produce national, regional and continental totals.

It is important to note that the totals presented for each country and region are minimum numbers, based on the areas that have been surveyed or for which guesses are available. It should also be noted, however, that the totals can include relatively old estimates and if the population is declining, this will yield an overestimate, while it will understate the true number of elephants in an increasing population. In many countries, and in all regions, there are large areas of elephant range where neither surveys nor guesses are available. In the case of Gabon, a modeled extrapolation has been used to generate a guess for unsurveyed areas of the country. This is because there is a large proportion of known range in Gabon that has not been surveyed, but the factors affecting elephant numbers are well known. As the available estimates generally represent only a proportion of the elephant range in a country, they cannot be considered total estimates of the national population. Likewise, the estimates given for the regions and for the continent cannot be interpreted as total regional and continental estimates either.

### Changes in Elephant Numbers and Distribution Over Time

A key question for African elephant conservation and management is whether elephant populations are increasing, decreasing or stable. Comparing estimates from different AESRs to derive continental trends is often attempted but can be invalid and potentially misleading for a number of reasons.

Many of the continent’s elephant populations have never been systematically surveyed. Thus any differences reported between the AESRs refer to a subset of all elephant populations, and may therefore not reflect overall changes, including those in unsurveyed populations. While it is likely that elephant densities in unsurveyed range are lower on average than in surveyed areas, there still may be significant numbers of elephants in areas for which there are no currently estimates or guesses.

Populations surveyed for the first time or populations newly added to the AED (i.e. “new populations” in Table 4) contribute to an apparent overall increase in numbers, even though these do not reflect a true increase in elephants, but rather an improvement in knowledge. Repeated surveys of the same area may use different techniques or cover different areas, so the results are not directly comparable between different time periods. Where new surveys have not been carried out recently, old estimates will be retained and, over time, degraded to guesses. Retention of these numbers for a significant proportion of the population can lead to a situation where the extent of real change is not reflected in the AESR totals. 

In order to disentangle these confounding factors from real changes in elephant numbers, the AED relies on a system that links figures contained in the current version of the AED to the corresponding figures in the previous AESR 2007 report, and assigns a “reason for change” to each pair, as described in Table 4. The AESR then displays the numbers associated with these reasons for change at the national, regional and continental levels.

### Overall Quality of Information and Survey Priorities

The state of knowledge on elephant numbers and distribution varies widely across the continent. Some populations have never been surveyed, or are only surveyed rarely, while others are counted more frequently. The objectives of the AED include promoting the use of standardized, reliable survey techniques, as well as facilitating the task of donors, wildlife authorities and decision-makers in prioritizing their efforts to monitor elephant populations.

In order to assist in meeting these objectives, a simple index measures the quality of elephant population data available at the national, regional and continental levels. Based on this index, a system to identify and prioritize the areas where systematic surveys are most needed has been developed. These measures, both of which are calculated from data contained in the AED, are described below.

**The Information Quality Index (IQI)** is an unbiased, normalized and scalable index of the overall quality of information on elephant population estimates and guesses. The IQI ranges from zero (no reliable information) to one (full range coverage using good-quality estimates) and is the product of two key variables: a measure of the quality of available data and a measure of the completeness of estimate coverage. The data quality measure is based on the ratio of good quality population data (estimates) to total population data (estimates + guesses); the data completeness measure is based on the ratio of assessed range to total known and possible range.

The **Priority for Future Surveys (PFS)** index is designed as an unbiased system for setting priorities for future surveys in order to improve the accuracy of the continental estimate. For a truly accurate continental picture of elephant abundance to emerge, reliable estimates would have to be available for all elephant range. Countries accounting for a larger proportion of total continental range should therefore be prioritized more highly.

PFS is therefore based on the IQI (as described above) together with a measure of continental range coverage represented by each country. When calculated for each country, the PFS provides a measure, ranging from one (highest priority) to five (lowest priority), of the countries where population surveys are needed. At the input zone level, the PFS is based on the proportion of national range accounted for by each area. All areas of elephant range that have never been surveyed, i.e. those for which estimates are currently unavailable, are automatically assigned a priority of one. Systematic surveys should be conducted in areas of unsurveyed known range. In areas of doubtful range and unsurveyed possible range, elephant presence/absence should be established prior to conducting systematic population surveys.

It is important to stress that neither the IQI nor the PFS are measures of the health of elephant populations, or of overall elephant conservation priorities, but rather of the quality of elephant pop-ulation data and of the need to conduct systematic surveys in the future. For instance, range loss in a country will often result in a decline in the proportion of unassessed range, thus causing the IQI to increase and the priority ranking to decline. While it is hoped that the PFS system will prove useful for prioritizing populations needing to be surveyed, the system is not intended to be prescriptive. Individual range states may have good reasons to use different criteria and different systems for prioritizing elephant population surveys.

Further details on how the IQI and PFS are calculated are available in the “Data Types and Categories” section of the AESR 2007.

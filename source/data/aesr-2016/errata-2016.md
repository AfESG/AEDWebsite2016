## Errata 2016

The African Elephant Status Report 2016 contains a number of errata which are listed below. This list is periodically updated and is up to date with known errata as of 23rd March 2017. 

*Please contact the African Elephant Specialist Group at afesg@iucn.org to let us know if you discover any errata.*

**Central Africa**
*Chad*
* **Map:** Elephant estimate tables contain three input zones that are labelled on the map but do not have input zone area boundaries. These are: *Baké - Yamodo - Goré Area*, *Larmanaye* and *Ngourou - Gondeï (Aouk) Area* (PDF page 63; Print copy page 52).
* **Map:** The area of known range in the *Siniaka-Minia FnR* input zone should no longer be marked as range as there are no elephants there (note: it is included in the 2015 Chad National Elephant Action Plan) (PDF page 63; Print copy page 52).

*Gabon*
* **Map:** Certain input zones are misaligned with the southern section of the national border (PDF page 87; Print copy page 74).

**Eastern Africa**
*Tanzania*
* **Reason for Change Table:** The Data Degraded row reads **-100** in the ‘Guesses; To’ column but should read 0. The total of the ‘Guesses; To’ column should read **-318** (PDF page 128; Print copy page 116).

*Rwanda*
* **Map:** The input zone for *Akagera National Park* does not align with the national border (PDF page 115; Print copy page 102).

**Southern Africa**
*Angola*
* **Elephant Estimate Table:** The estimate for *Cáua Camp* should number 89 (Carmingnani, 2015) and be an informed guess (PDF page 149; Print copy page 137).
* **Map:** The input zone area for *Cáua Camp* is too large and should cover a smaller area (PDF page 150; Print copy page 138).

*Mozambique*
* **Elephant Estimate Table:** *Rest of Mozambique range* is categorised as an ‘Other guess’ (Reliability E) but should be an ‘Informed guess’ (Reliability D) – this is correct in the narrative (PDF page 167; Print copy page 155).

*South Africa*
* **Elephant Estimate Table:** *Other private reserves* has not been given an area but are estimated to have a total area of 2,000 km2 (PDF page 179; Print copy page 167). 

**West Africa**
*Côte D’Ivoire*
* **Elephant Estimate Table:** The source of the estimate for Comoé National Park should be ‘Lapuente, pers. comm., 2016’ instead of ‘Merz & Hoppe-Dominik, 1991’. This is correct in the narrative (PDF page 222; Print copy page 211).
* **Map:** Known elephant range for Comoé National Park should extend east into the park across the river into the middle of the park and the east half of the park should be marked as possible range (PDF page 223; Print copy page 212).  

**General**
*Maps*
* Some input zones have wavy lines instead of straight lines.

## Executive Summary

* * *

This is the fifth printed African Elephant Status Report (AESR) produced by the African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) of the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC). Like its predecessors, the AESR 2016 is based on data from the African Elephant Database (AED), the most comprehensive database on the status of any species of mammal in the wild. This is the first comparison of continental populations between 2006 and 2015 across the 37 range states of the African elephant. Importantly this report not only provides information on changes in elephant numbers but also, because it is spatial, shows where these changes have taken place.
 
The AESR 2016 is the most authoritative and up-to-date compilation of information on the numbers and distribution of the African elephant at national, regional and continental levels across all range states in sub-Saharan Africa. The last year of data collected for this report is 2015. The title follows the convention of using the year of publication rather than the last year of data collection. We hope this report contributes to a wider discussion about the value of monitoring to conservation and to addressing the needs of the African Elephant Action Plan (AEAP), ensuring that policy decisions and the assessment of conservation activities and their performance are evidence-based, and that new conservation initiatives budget for support to monitoring programmes including the AED.

Status reports are intended to help address contemporary elephant management and conservation needs and, therefore, a key question is how the estimates and guesses in the AESR 2016 relate to the true number of elephants in Africa at the end of 2015. When populations are declining, any time difference between the date of surveys and the cut-off date for the report will lead to the true number being lower than the recorded figure. This is more of an issue with the guesses than with estimates, since the largest savanna populations have all been surveyed within the last two years. There are also reasons why the AED may under-record the true number of elephants: aerial counts, which make up the majority of the estimates, tend to undercount the true number of elephants; many of the guesses come from areas which are known to contain substantial elephant populations but have just not been surveyed to the standard required for an estimate; and there are areas of elephant range for which there are no estimates or guesses. On balance the true number of elephants are likely greater than the estimates based on surveys alone, though not necessarily greater than the combined estimates and guesses.
 
The AESR 2016 provides sound scientific evidence, a deep understanding of the context and a strong technical base to support the management and conservation of Africa’s elephants across their range.

### The Continental Overview

The desire to conserve and manage elephants is widespread, and even if opinions differ as to how best this goal can be achieved, it is widely agreed that decisions should be informed by the most up-to-date and reliable information available on the numbers and distribution of Africa’s elephants.

Since the publication of the AESR 2007, this goal has been furthered among the African elephant range states through their joint development and adoption by consensus of the African Elephant Action Plan (African elephant range states, 2010), which provides objectives, strategies, and activities for the conservation and management of Africa’s elephants. The AEAP recognizes the fundamental importance of monitoring progress and performance through constant reassessment of information on the status of the species throughout its range.

The AfESG and its AED occupy a unique and pivotal position with regard to this need, having been designated as the repository for information on the conservation status of the species by the parties to CITES (CITES Conference of the Parties, 2013a).

This report presents more than 275 new or updated estimates for elephant populations across Africa, with over 180 of these arising from systematic surveys. All aerial survey data from the Great Elephant Census, (greatelephantcensus.com), a Paul G. Allen project, and data from dung counts in Central Africa carried out primarily by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) were submitted through the AED for inclusion in this report.

In the AESR 2016, the estimated number of elephants in areas surveyed in the last ten years in Africa is 415,428 ± 20,111 at the time of the last survey for each area. There may be an additional 117,127 to 135,384 elephants in areas not systematically surveyed. Together, this estimate and guess apply to 1,932,732 km², which is 62% of the estimated known and possible elephant range. There remains an additional 38% of range for which no elephant population estimates are available, although it is likely that average elephant densities in this range are much lower than in the surveyed areas.
 
This is the first AESR in 25 years that has reported a continental decline in elephant numbers. Between the AESR 2007 and this report, there has been a reduction of approximately 118,000 in estimates for populations where comparable surveys have been carried out. However, some populations have been surveyed for the first time, particularly in Central Africa, and this has led to an increase of approximately 18,000 in the “new population” category. The result is that the total estimated number of elephants from surveys has decreased by a smaller figure of about 93,000 since the AESR 2007. The estimated number of elephants from surveys and guesses combined has decreased since the AESR 2007 by about 104,000-114,000.
 
The decline is largely caused by the surge in poaching for ivory that began around 2006 (CITES, 2016), the worst that Africa has experienced since the 1970s and 1980s. Losses in Tanzania account for the major share of this decline. Other underlying drivers of population decline, such as loss of habitat and increasing human elephant conflict, are still of critical conservation importance but have been receiving less attention from managers, conservationists and policy-makers due to the immediacy of the poaching crisis.
 
Continuing uncertainties about the number of elephants in Botswana have a substantial potential impact on continental population estimates. Botswana holds the single largest population but national estimates since 2006 have differed by as much as 80,000 elephants.  In order to better understand the current status of this critically important population, which is shared with four neighbouring countries, a coordinated survey of the entire cross-border population of Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe remains a high priority.

The proportion of elephant range for which elephant estimates are available currently stands at 62%, which has increased from 51% since the previous report. The overall reliability of estimates has increased considerably, with estimates from systematic surveys now accounting for 37% of total range, compared to 29% in the previous report.
 
Holding over 70% of the estimated elephants in Africa (56% of estimated and guessed elephants) in 42% of the total range area for the species, Southern Africa has by far the largest number of elephants in any of the four regions. Eastern Africa comes second, with 20% of estimated elephants (18% of estimated and guessed elephants) in 28% of the range, while Central Africa is an even more distant third (6%) for estimated elephants in 25% of the range. There remain a high proportion of guesses for Central Africa, giving a total of 23% of estimated and guessed elephants. West Africa continues to hold the smallest regional population with under 3% of both categories in the remaining 5% of range.
  
Improved knowledge of elephant distribution is reflected by the proportion of range categorised as known, which has increased from 63% to 67%. Significant range expansion has occurred in Botswana and Kenya. The actual distribution of elephants across this range varies considerably across the four regions – from small, fragmented populations in West Africa to large, virtually undisturbed tracts of elephant range in Central and Southern Africa, with a mixture in Eastern Africa.

### The Regional Overview

#### Central Africa

Central Africa’s elephants have been severely affected by ivory poaching over the past ten years (CITES, 2015b; Maisels, Strindberg et al., 2013b; UNEP et al., 2013; Wittemyer et al., 2014). Evidence from the carcass reports sent to MIKE shows that poaching was already a problem in this region by 2003, long before it became unsustainable in Eastern Africa (CITES Secretariat, 2016).
 
The estimated number of elephants in areas surveyed in the last ten years in Central Africa is 24,119 ± 2,865 at the time of the last survey for each area. There may be an additional 87,190 to 103,355 elephants in areas not systematically surveyed. Together, this estimate and guess apply to 546,471 km², which is 70% of the estimated known and possible elephant range in the region. The number of elephants estimated from systematic surveys in Central Africa increased by about 10,000 between the AESR 2007 and the present. However, this was largely a consequence of “new populations” being surveyed and in some cases there have been major reductions in these populations in subsequent surveys.
 
Gabon and Congo still hold Africa’s most important forest elephant populations but both have been affected by heavy poaching in recent years. Some populations in Cameroon have also been badly impacted, as has Chad’s largest remaining population in Zakouma National Park, which has now stabilized. The savanna populations of the Central African Republic have almost completely disappeared, with the only remaining populations occurring in the forested south-west. There are only small remnant populations in Democratic Republic of Congo and Equatorial Guinea.

Populations recorded as having been lost in the last ten years have included one in Chad and another in the DRC. However, since populations in the extensive Central African forests are much less clearly defined than in other parts of Africa, loss of numbers and range is more likely to be recorded than that of discrete populations. 

Substantial changes have been made to the range maps, but these are mostly the result of improved information, rather than real changes in range. There has been a decrease of recorded range from about 975,000 km² to about 780,000 km² with known range decreasing from 82% to 58%.

#### Eastern Africa


Eastern Africa has been the region most affected by poaching, having experienced an approximately 50% population decline in estimates from surveys since the AESR 2007, largely attributed to a greater than 60% decline in Tanzania’s elephant numbers. 

The estimated number of elephants in areas surveyed in the last ten years in Eastern Africa is 86,373 ± 10,549 at the time of the last survey for each area. There may be an additional 11,973 to 12,060 elephants in areas not systematically surveyed.

Together, this estimate and guess apply to 548,587 km², which is 62% of the estimated known and possible elephant range in the region, a significant improvement on the 45% of estimated known and possible elephant range assessed in the AESR 2007, that resulted in reported survey estimates of 165,151 ± 27,990 and an additional 10,722 to 12,066 guesses in areas not systematically surveyed.
  
Between the AESR 2007 and this report, elephant numbers in Eastern Africa have declined by almost 87,000, on the basis of updated estimates for sites where comparable survey techniques were employed. However, some populations have been surveyed for the first time and this has led to an increase of approximately 9,000 in the “new population” category. The result is that the current total number of elephants from surveyed populations represents a smaller estimated reduction of about 79,000 elephants, still close to a 50% loss, during the period from late 2006 to the end of 2015.

Elephant numbers have been stable or increasing since the AESR 2007 in Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda and Ethiopia, although these national level figures include reductions in some of their populations. Significant losses have been recorded in Tanzania. There has been an apparent increase in elephant numbers in South Sudan, because the major populations were surveyed for the first time in 30 years after 2006, and it is suspected that there is no longer a resident elephant population in Somalia. 

No populations are recorded as having been lost in Eastern Africa.

While there has been no net increase in range, known range has increased from 57% to 85% of total range in 2015. Range expansion is reported in two areas of Kenya.

#### Southern Africa


Southern Africa continues to hold by far the largest number of elephants on the continent, and nearly 75% of these elephants form part of a single population in the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA TFCA), some 520,000 km² in extent. Whereas conservation challenges associated with high elephant densities in large protected areas were common in the region a decade ago, contemporary elephant conservation in southern Africa is now also faced with the emergence of a growing poaching threat (UNEP et al., 2013). While overall, poaching has not had the same impact in Southern Africa as in other regions it has severely affected populations in Zimbabwe, Angola, Mozambique and to a lesser extent, Zambia.
 
The estimated number of elephants in areas surveyed in the last ten years in Southern Africa is 293,447 ± 16,682 at the time of the last survey for each area. There may be an additional 15,157 to 16,672 elephants in areas not systematically surveyed. These guesses likely represent a minimum number, and actual numbers could be higher than those reported. Together, this estimate and guess apply to 734,824 km², which is 55% of the estimated known and possible elephant range in the region.

Between the AESR 2007 and this report, elephant numbers in Southern Africa have declined by almost 30,000, on the basis of updated estimates for sites where comparable survey techniques were employed. However, some populations have been surveyed for the first time and this has led to an increase of approximately 3,000 in the “new population” category.  The result is that the current total number of elephants from surveyed populations represents a smaller estimated reduction of about 27,000 elephants. Although there have been real declines in Mozambique and Zimbabwe, the main contributor to this decline is a reduction in the estimate for Botswana, which may be the result of uncounted elephants, range expansion, increased poaching or methodological differences between surveys. Some major populations in Namibia (Zambezi, Etosha NP and Khaudum NP), South Africa (Kruger NP) and Zimbabwe (South-east Lowveld and North-west Matabeleland) are stable or increasing.

Southern Africa has a relatively high reliability and quantity of elephant information, especially for the larger populations. Although overall survey coverage has increased since 2007, largely as a result
of the Great Elephant Census carried out in 2014-2015, there is still wide variation amongst countries.
 
One population is reported as having been lost from Angola.

The current range area for Southern Africa is 1,325,998 km², a slight increase from the 1,305,140 km² recorded in the AESR 2007, and the percentage of this which is known range has increased from 53% to 60%. There has been no major loss of elephant range, and one notable southern expansion of range in Botswana. Other changes result from improved information, particularly in Angola.

#### West Africa


West Africa’s elephant populations are mostly small, fragmented and isolated. With increasing human populations and infrastructural development, many countries in West Africa are experiencing increased pressure on natural areas from mining, logging and rapid transformation of land to agriculture.
 
The AESR 2016 provides more information than previous status reports on countries known to have small, isolated and highly vulnerable populations, with some stark results. Although numbers are small relative to continental levels, West Africa reported losing twelve populations of elephants since the AESR 2007: one each in Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Sierra Leone and Togo; two in Guinea and five in Nigeria. It is surprising, however, that there is recent evidence for the continued survival of a number of populations that were already at a very low level 10-20 years ago.  The transfrontier “WAP” complex that straddles the border between Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger remains the region’s largest population and of great significance as one of West Africa’s few populations with potential long-term viability.
 
The estimated number of elephants in areas surveyed within the last ten years in West Africa is 11,489 ± 2,583 at the time of the last survey for each area. There may be an additional 2,886 to 3,376 elephants in areas not systematically surveyed. These guesses likely represent a minimum number, and actual numbers could be higher than those reported. Together, this estimate and guess apply to 102,850 km², which is 72% of the estimated known and possible elephant range in the region.
 
The overall numbers of elephants in West Africa appear to have increased since 2006. This is largely due to the apparent growth in the WAP complex population.

At the national level, population estimates for both Benin and Burkina Faso suggest increases in the WAP complex.  Estimates for Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo have stayed more or less constant with some higher and lower guesses, while estimates for Guinea, Mali and Nigeria have declined since 2006. Guinea’s elephants are now reduced to a single small population. Niger’s few remaining elephants are thought to still move in and out of the country as part of the WAP complex. Information on Liberia’s elephants has been substantially improved in this report, adding a small number to guesses originating from 1989/90.
 
A substantial update of the West African elephant range has been completed for this report, and this has the effect of reducing the total range (known and possible) from around 176,000 km2 to approximately 143,000 km², but the percentage of known range has increased from 71% to 79%.

### The AED Online

Since the AESR 2007, the AED has moved to an online, web-based platform africanelephantdatabase.org. This online resource, which was launched initially in 2012 and has been substantially redesigned and updated to coincide with the production of this report, not only offers a platform for displaying data between the published status reports, but also provides new ways to view the data from all the status reports and access more detailed information on new surveys than are presented in this report.  Readers are encouraged to visit the website to further explore the data.
 
With the transition to an online platform, the AED has undergone a very significant change. This has been both challenging and rewarding and lessons we have learnt are being used by other groups working on species databases. In the years to come, we hope to demonstrate meaningful advances in the analytical potential of the AED to provide a strong and relevant evidence base for the management and conservation of the African elephant.
